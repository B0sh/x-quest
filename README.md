X-Quest is an 80s arcade-inspired action game. It features 9 levels that slowly ramp up in difficulty and then it continues on forever at the same difficulty in pursuit of high scores. (Even though the High Score list is easily hacked). There are two distinct game modes: Normal and Nightmare which have their own seperate leaderboard. It also features a lifetime statictics tracker through localStorage.
